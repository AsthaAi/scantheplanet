name: 'SAFE-T1002: Supply Chain Compromise'
severity: high
summary: |-
  Supply chain compromise when remote code or artifacts are fetched and trusted without
  integrity verification, pinning, or signature checks.
description: |-
  Tactic: Initial Access (ATK-TA0001). Technique: SAFE-T1002. Severity: high.
  Detection guidance:
  - Look for code that downloads, installs, imports, or executes external packages,
    plugins, model weights, or binaries without integrity checks or pinning.
  - Require a concrete execution or load path (for example: pip/npm install from URL,
    dynamic import from remote content, or downloaded code executed).
  Exclusions:
  - Do not flag read-only documentation fetches or API calls that do not execute or load code.
  - Do not flag generic HTTP GET/POST calls unless the response is executed, imported, or loaded as code.
